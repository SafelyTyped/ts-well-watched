# Welcome To @safelytyped/well-watched!

## Introduction

_Well-Watched_ is a safe type for working with dynamic watch lists.

It's inspired by the way Vuex registers and manages its list of subscribers.

## Quick Start

```
# run this from your Terminal
npm install @safelytyped/well-watched
```

```typescript
// add this import to your Typescript code
import { Value } from "@safelytyped/well-watched"
```

__VS Code users:__ once you've added a single import anywhere in your project, you'll then be able to auto-import anything else that this library exports.
